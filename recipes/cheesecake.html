      For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour
      cream, vanilla & salt),<br />it took a lot longer than you might think to
      develop the perfect version.

            Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker
            crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar,<br />and stirring well. Add melted
            butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well. 1 1/2 cups graham
            cracker<br />crumbs, 2 Tablespoons sugar, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar,
            7 Tablespoons butter

            Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the
            bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.

          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer)
            add cream cheese and stir until smooth and <br />creamy (don’t
            over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li  class="paragraph-ins">Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until
            well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause<br />
            periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a
            spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a
            time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated.<br />Once
            all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and
            bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients<br />
            are well combined.

          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure
            against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined<br />with
            foil.

          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for
            50-60 minutes (or longer as needed, see note 3).<br />Edges will
            likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light
            golden brown and the center should spring<br />back to the touch but
            will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will
            suffer, which means we all suffer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven⁴ for 10
            minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently<br />loosen
            the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help
            prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).<br />Do not
            remove the ring of the springform pan.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-ins">
            Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room
            temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to<br />cool
            overnight or at least 6 hours. I remove the ring of the springform
            pan just before serving then return it to the pan to store.<br />Enjoy!
