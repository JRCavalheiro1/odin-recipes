    <p>
      Making popcorn from scratch can be tricky. Not only do you want<br />as
      many kernels as possible to pop, but you also want to keep the<br />kernels
      from burning at the bottom of the pan.
    </p>

    <div class="ingredients">
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or more to taste, optional</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h3>Directions</h3>

      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>
        Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high
        heat.<br />
        If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>
        Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil and wait for the popcorn kernels
        to pop.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <p>
        Add the rest of the popcorn. When the kernels pop, add the rest of the
        1/3
        <br />cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <p>
        Cover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds. This method first
        heats<br />the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds
        brings all of the other<br />kernels to a near-popping temperature so
        that when they are put back on the heat,<br />they all pop at about the
        same time.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 5</h4>
      <p>
        Return the pan to the heat. The popcorn should begin popping soon, and
        all at once.<br />Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the
        pan by moving it back and forth<br />over the burner.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 6</h4>
      <p>
        Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan
        from the heat.<br />Remove the lid and dump the popcorn immediately into
        a wide bowl. With this technique,<br />nearly all of the kernels pop,
        and nothing burns.
