      <h3>Instructions</h3>

      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>
        Trim any excess fat from chicken. Place a piece of plastic or parchment
        on top of each chicken<br />breast on a solid, level surface, and pound
        the thick end of chicken to flatten to an even thickness.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>
        Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Add olive oil, Dijon,
        honey, soy sauce, lemon juice,<br />garlic, onion powder, and ginger to
        the bag. Press any excess air out of the bag and seal the bag
        tightly.<br />Massage chicken around in the bag until marinade is fully
        incorporated and chicken is well coated.<br />Refrigerate for at least 4
        hours or overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <p>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, about 400 degrees F (200 degrees
        C). Brush the grill grates with<br />oil or coat with cooking spray.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <p>
        Place chicken, top side down, on the grill. Sprinkle evenly with salt.
        Cook, undisturbed, until chicken easily<br />releases from the grill and
        has dark brown grill marks, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees
        F (175 degrees C)<br />or medium heat, then flip and cook an additional
        5 to 7 minutes or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of
        165<br />degrees F (73 degrees C). Remove from heat and let stand 5 to
        10 minutes before serving.
